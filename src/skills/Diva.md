# Understanding u-he Diva `.h2p` Preset Files

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the `.h2p` preset file format for the u-he Diva software synthesizer. Its purpose is to serve as a technical reference for an LLM to understand, analyze, generate, and modify Diva presets. The information is compiled by mapping the parameters and values in the text-based preset files to the features and controls described in the Diva User Guide (v1.4.8).

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** When analyzing Diva presets, the filter parameters (VCF1) are THE most important sound-shaping elements. Filter cutoff, resonance, and their modulation sources/depths determine the fundamental character of the sound more than any other module. Always examine these parameters first when analyzing a preset.

## 2. Preset File Structure

A `.h2p` file is a text file containing key-value pairs that define every parameter of a synth patch. It is structured into several distinct sections.

### 2.1. Metadata Block

The file begins with a multi-line comment block containing descriptive metadata for use in Diva's preset browser.

```
/*@Meta

Bank:
'Diva Factory 1.0'
Author:
'Howard Scarr'
Usage:
'MW = wobble'
Categories:
'Bass:Sub'
Features:
'Mono, Dry, Percussive, Glide'
Character:
'Dark, Constant, Clean, Phat, Modern'

*/
```

*   **`Bank`**: The sound bank or collection the preset belongs to.
*   **`Author`**: The name of the sound designer.
*   **`Usage`**: Performance notes, explaining how to use controllers like the Mod Wheel (`MW`) or Aftertouch (`AT`).
*   **`Categories`**: Describes the preset's instrument type or genre (e.g., `Bass:Sub`, `Pads:Rhythmic`).
*   **`Features`**: Technical classifications of the sound (e.g., `Mono`, `Poly`, `BPM`, `Percussive`).
*   **`Character`**: Subjective descriptions of the sound's timbre and feel (e.g., `Dark`, `Moving`, `Vintage`).

### 2.2. Header and Modulation Sources

Following the metadata, global identifiers and the full list of modulation sources are defined.

*   **`#AM=Diva`**: Identifies the synthesizer.
*   **`#Vers=...`**: The preset format version.
*   **`#nm=24`**: Declares the number of modulation sources available (24 in this case).
*   **`#ms=...`**: A list of all 24 modulation sources. The order of this list is crucial, as parameters ending in `Src` (e.g., `FMSrc`) use a zero-based index from this list.

### 2.3. Module Configuration (`#cm=...`)

The bulk of the file consists of module blocks, each starting with `#cm=` followed by the module name (e.g., `#cm=OSC`, `#cm=VCF1`). These blocks contain the parameter settings for that specific part of the synthesizer.

### 2.4. Binary Data Block

The file ends with a block of compressed binary data, which should not be modified.
`$$$$...`

## 3. Modulation Source Mapping

Parameters that select a modulation source (e.g., `FMSrc`, `ModSrc`, `DMS1`) use a 0-based index referring to the `#ms` list defined at the top of the preset file.

## 4. Filter Analysis: The Most Critical Module

**The VCF1 (Main Filter) module is THE primary sound-shaping element in Diva presets.** When analyzing a preset, always examine the filter parameters first, as they have more impact on the final sound than oscillators, envelopes, or effects.

### 4.1. Filter Parameter Importance Hierarchy

1. **VCF1/Freq (Cutoff Frequency)** - The single most important parameter
   - Range: 30-150, Typical average: ~74
   - Determines the fundamental brightness/darkness of the sound
   - MUST be analyzed in combination with modulation to understand the actual frequency sweep range

2. **VCF1/Res (Resonance/Emphasis)** - Second most critical parameter
   - Range: 0-100, Typical average: ~29 (but highly variable!)
   - Dramatically affects timbre: 0 = smooth, >50 = aggressive/metallic, >80 = self-oscillation territory
   - Low resonance (~0-20): Clean, transparent filtering
   - Medium resonance (~20-50): Classic analog character
   - High resonance (~50-100): Aggressive, pronounced peak, potential screaming/whistling

3. **VCF1/FMDpt (Primary Modulation Depth)** - Critical for sound movement
   - Range: -120 to +120, Typical average: ~40
   - **Nearly all presets use significant filter modulation** - this is not optional!
   - Positive values: Modulation opens the filter (typically from envelope)
   - Negative values: Modulation closes the filter (rare, special effects)
   - The ACTUAL filter frequency range = Static Freq Â± (FMDpt * modulation source level)

4. **VCF1/FMSrc (Primary Modulation Source)** - Defines filter movement character
   - Most common: Index 15 (ENV2) - creates classic attack/decay filter sweeps
   - Also common: Index 17 (LFO2) - creates cyclic filter movement
   - Index 0 (none) - static filter, no movement (rare in musical presets)

5. **VCF1/FM2Dpt & VCF1/FM2Src (Secondary Modulation)** - Adds complexity
   - Average depth: ~15 (about half of primary modulation)
   - Often uses velocity (index 6), mod wheel (index 1), or LFO1 (index 16)
   - Creates dynamic, performance-controllable filter behavior

### 4.2. Analyzing Filter Settings in Practice

When you see a preset with:
- `VCF1/Freq = 68`, `VCF1/Res = 45`, `VCF1/FMSrc = 15` (ENV2), `VCF1/FMDpt = 60`

**Interpret as:**
- **Base cutoff**: 68 (medium-bright static frequency)
- **Resonance**: 45 (moderate-to-strong emphasis, classic analog character)
- **Filter sweep**: Envelope 2 will sweep the filter from ~8 (68-60) to ~128 (68+60)
  - This is a WIDE sweep from very dark to very bright
  - The envelope's attack/decay/sustain determines the speed and shape of this sweep
- **Result**: This preset will have a strong "wah" filter opening characteristic typical of analog bass/lead sounds

### 4.3. Common Filter Patterns

**Classic Bass Sound:**
- Low static Freq (40-60), High FMDpt (60-100), ENV2 as source
- The filter starts closed and sweeps open with the envelope

**Pad/String Sound:**
- Medium-high Freq (80-100), Low-medium FMDpt (10-40), Slow ENV2
- Gentle, slow filter movement for evolving textures

**Pluck Sound:**
- Medium Freq (60-80), Medium-high FMDpt (40-70), Fast ENV2 attack/decay
- Quick filter snap that decays rapidly

**Static/Organ Sound:**
- Any Freq, FMDpt = 0 or very low (<10), Res often 0
- Minimal or no filter movement

### 4.4. HPF (High-Pass Filter) Role

The HPF is secondary to VCF1 but important for:
- Removing low-end rumble (typical Freq: 40-60, Res: 0-20)
- Creating thin, aggressive tones (Freq: 80-120, Res: 20-60)
- Average HPF Res is much lower (~11) than VCF1 Res (~29)
- Often used subtly; many presets use HPF Model 0 (no HPF, just feedback)

### 5.3. Filters (`#cm=HPF` & `#cm=VCF1`)

**CRITICAL: See Section 4 for comprehensive filter analysis guidance. This section provides technical parameter mappings; Section 4 explains how to interpret them for sound analysis.**

Diva has two filter stages: a pre-filter (HPF or Feedback) and the main filter (VCF).

#### `#cm=HPF` (High-pass Filters / Feedback)
| Parameter | UI Name | Description & Value Mapping |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Model` | HPF Model | Selects the module type. `0`: No HPF (Just Feedback), `1`: HPF Post, `2`: HPF Pre, `3`: HPF Bite. |
| `Freq` | Frequency / Feedback | Controls cutoff frequency for HPF models, or feedback amount for the "No HPF" model. |
| `Res` | Resonance / Peak | Controls resonance for HPF Pre/Bite models. |
| `FMSrc` | Mod Source | Modulation source for cutoff/feedback. |
| `FMDpt` | Mod Amount | Modulation depth for cutoff/feedback. |

#### `#cm=VCF1` (Main Voltage Controlled Filter)

**This is THE most important module in the preset. Always analyze these parameters first.**

| Parameter | UI Name | Description & Value Mapping | Typical Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Model` | Filter Model | Selects the main filter type. `1`: Ladder, `2`: Cascade, `3`: Multimode, `4`: Bite, `5`: Uhbie. | Varies by sound design choice |

| `Fback` | Feedback | Amount of post-filter signal feedback (used with Triple VCO oscillator). | 0-100, use sparingly |

**Analysis Workflow:** Always examine VCF1 in this order:
1. Check `Freq` (base cutoff)
2. Check `Res` (resonance character)
3. Check `FMSrc` and `FMDpt` (primary modulation - defines the sweep)
4. Calculate effective frequency range: Freq Â± FMDpt
5. Check `FM2Src` and `FM2Dpt` (secondary modulation - adds expression)
6. Cross-reference `FMSrc`/`FM2Src` with their respective envelope/LFO settings

### 5.4. Envelopes & Amplifier

**Important:** Envelope 2 (ENV2) is typically the primary filter modulation source. When analyzing a preset with filter modulation, always examine ENV2's ADSR settings to understand the filter's temporal behavior.

| `PanDpt` | Pan Mod Amount | Modulation depth for panning. |

### 5.5. LFOs (`#cm=LFO1` & `#cm=LFO2`)

**Note:** LFO2 (index 17) is commonly used as a secondary filter modulation source for vibrato/wobble effects.

| Parameter | UI Name | Description & Value Mapping |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Sync` | Sync / Rate | LFO rate. Values > 0 are tempo-synced (e.g., `13`=1/4), values < 0 are free-running in Hz. |
| `Rate` | Rate (Offset) | Fine-tunes the LFO rate relative to the main Sync setting. |
| `Wave` | Waveform | `0`: sine, `1`: triangle, `2`: saw up, `3`: saw down, `4`: sqr hi-lo, `5`: sqr lo-hi, `6`: rand hold, `7`: rand glide. |

### 5.6. Effects (`#cm=FX1` & `#cm=FX2`)

Diva has two serial effects slots. The configuration for both is stored in the preset, even if they are turned off.

| Parameter | UI Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Module` | Effect Type | A string defining the active effect for the slot (e.g., `'Delay1'`, `'Plate2'`, `'Chorus1'`). |

Each effect type has its own set of parameters stored in a corresponding block (e.g., `#cm=Plate1`, `#cm=Delay1`).

#### Example: `#cm=Delay1` Parameters

## 6. Conclusion & Analysis Priority

This guide provides a foundational context for an LLM to interpret Diva's `.h2p` preset format.

**When analyzing ANY Diva preset, follow this priority order:**

1. **VCF1 Filter (Section 4)** - Start here ALWAYS
   - Freq, Res, FMSrc, FMDpt - these define 70% of the sound character
   - Calculate the effective filter frequency range

2. **ENV2 (if used for filter mod)** - Second priority
   - Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release - defines filter movement timing
   - This envelope shapes the filter sweep from step 1

3. **Oscillators (Section 5.2)** - Third priority
   - Waveforms, detune, FM, sync - defines the raw harmonic content
   - Remember: filters shape this content dramatically

4. **ENV1 & VCA (Section 5.4)** - Fourth priority
   - Amplitude envelope shapes overall volume
   - Usually simpler and less impactful than filter envelope

5. **Everything else** - Final considerations
   - LFOs, effects, HPF, etc. - add polish and movement

**Key Insight:** A preset with simple oscillators and sophisticated filter settings will sound far more interesting than one with complex oscillators and static filtering. The filter IS the sound.
