Key points:\n\n- This is an ESM project (\"type\": \"module\" in package.json)\n- Uses Bun for development and testing, Node.js as production target\n- Tests use Bun's built-in test runner (bun:test)\n- Never modify binary sections of presets without deep understanding\n- Test changes across multiple synth types (Diva, Repro, Hive, Zebra)\n- Follow existing code patterns and conventions\n- Keep code focused on cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux, WSL2)\n\nWhen making changes, consider reading AGENTS.md first using the /context command.",
