Read and use the AGENTS.md file to understand the project architecture, conventions, and development workflow.

This project is a TypeScript CLI tool for randomizing u-he synthesizer presets. Pay special attention to:

1. The ESM module setup (requires special Jest configuration)
2. The core architecture (parser, analyzer, randomizer, preset library)
3. Testing conventions and patterns
4. The important considerations around preset binary sections

After reading AGENTS.md, confirm you understand the project structure and are ready to work on tasks.
